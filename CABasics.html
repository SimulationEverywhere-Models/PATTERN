<h1 align="center">4. B. Cellular Automaton Basics</h1>

<p align="justify">A cellular automaton (CA) is defined by four attributes:

</p><p align="justify">1.  The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/StateSpace.html">state space</a>, the model of the world, 
a collection of cells.

</p><p align="justify">2.  The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/Nbhd.html">neighborhood</a> (nbhd) of a cell.  Those 
cells whose current states affect the next state of a cell.  

</p><p align="justify">3.  The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/StateNumber.html">number of states</a> a cell can assume.  
This measures the level of detail at which we view the cells.  

</p><p align="justify">4.  The <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/Rule.html">rule</a> of the CA: how the current states of 
the cells in the nbhd determine the next state of a cell.  

</p><p align="justify">


</p><p align="justify">This seems awfully simple, especially if the number of states 
is few and the neighborhood size small.  As a hint of the possible richness involved, we 
calculate the number of CA rules.

</p><p align="justify">We have already seen with S states per cell and N cells per nbhd, there are 
<a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/StateNumber.html">S<sup>N</sup> neighborhood configurations</a>.  A rule 
specifies eaxctly which of the S possible states results from each of the S<sup>N</sup> 
neighborhood configurations.  Suppose we number the neighborhood configurations 1 through 
S<sup>N</sup>.  Then there are S outcomes for configuration 1 and S outcomes for 
configuration 2, so S<sup>2</sup> combinations of outcomes for configurations 1 and 2.  

</p><p align="justify">Suppose S = 2, and write the states as 0 and 1.  Then the combinations 
for the first two neighborhood configurations are 

</p><p align="justify">00, 10, 01, 11

</p><p align="justify">Continuing, there are S<sup>3</sup> combinations of outcomes 
for configurations 1, 2, and 3.  For S = 2, here are the combinations for the first 
three neighborhood configurations

</p><p align="justify">000, 100, 010, 110, 001, 101, 011, 111

</p><p align="justify">In general, there are S<sup>(S<sup>N</sup>)</sup> rules.  How large 
is this number?

</p><p align="justify">S = 2, N = 3 gives 2<sup>(2<sup>3</sup>)</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 
rules.  Spending one minute investigating each rule, one person could see all the possibilities 
in 4 and 1/4 hours, a single afternoon.  

</p><p align="justify">S = 2, N = 5 gives 2<sup>(2<sup>5</sup>)</sup> = 2<sup>32</sup> = 
4,294,967,296 rules.  At one second per rule, a person would have to work 24 hours a 
day, every day without interruption for 136 years.  

</p><p align="justify">S = 2, N = 9 (two-dimensional Moore neighborhood automata) 
gives 2<sup>(2<sup>9</sup>)</sup> = 2<sup>512</sup> rules.  How 
<a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/BigNumber.gif">big</a> is this number?  If every elementary particle in the 
universe were a supercomputer examining a trillion CA per second, starting at the 
Big Bang, by now only one part in 10<sup>44</sup> would have been examined.  Failing 
some fundamental advance in the physics of computation (superstring computers working 
at superstring frequencies?), we will never, Never, NEVER see all the possibilities.       

</p><p align="justify">What happens for S = 3?  As a hint of what this small increase in 
S will do, note that for N = 3 we have <nobr>3<sup>(3<sup>3</sup>)</sup> = 
7,625,597,484,987</nobr> rules.  Recall there are 256 rules for S = 2 and N = 3.  
For S = 3 and N = 9 there are <nobr>3<sup>(3<sup>9</sup>)</sup> = 10<sup>9392</sup></nobr> 
rules.  

</p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify">Cellular automata are used to model physical, chemical, biological, and 
social interactions.  For many of these the exact positions of live cells in the 
neighborhood is not as important as the number of live cells.  Such CA are called <b>totalistic</b>.   
We are interested in an extension of this notion called <a href="http://classes.yale.edu/99-00/math190a/OT.html">outer totalistic</a>.
